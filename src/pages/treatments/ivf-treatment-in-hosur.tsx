In general, the cost of IVF treatment in Bangalore can range from around INR 1,50,000 to INR 3,50,000 per cycle, although some clinics may charge more or less. It is important to note that the cost of IVF can add up quickly, as most patients require multiple cycles to achieve a successful pregnancy. Some patients may also require additional procedures or medications, which can further increase the overall cost of treatment."

In general, the overall success rate of IVF is about 35% for women under the age of 35, declining to about 10-20% for women over the age of 40. However, it is important to note that these are just estimates, and the actual success rate can vary widely from one patient to another. As for the risks involved in IVF treatment, they are generally minimal and most patients do not experience any serious complications. Some common side effects of IVF may include bloating, cramping, breast tenderness, and mood changes. More serious risks, such as bleeding or infection, are rare but can occur. Additionally, there is a small risk of multiple pregnancies, which can pose additional health risks for both the mother and the babies."

These can include: Medications: The medications needed to stimulate egg production and prepare the uterus for pregnancy can be expensive. These medications are usually not covered by insurance. Genetic testing: Pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) can be done to check the health of the embryos before they are transferred to the uterus. Anesthesia: Some patients may need to be sedated for the egg retrieval procedure, which can add to the cost of the treatment. Storage of frozen embryos: If you have leftover embryos after the IVF cycle, you may choose to have them frozen for future use. Multiple cycles: It is common for patients to need more than one cycle of IVF in order to become pregnant. Each additional cycle can add to the overall cost of treatment.This can add to the cost of the treatment. It is important to discuss the potential costs of IVF treatment with your doctor and fertility clinic in order to fully understand the expenses you may incur."
