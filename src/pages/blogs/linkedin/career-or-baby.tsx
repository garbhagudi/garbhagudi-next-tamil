              Today’s women and men are successful beyond imagination, and there comes a time when
              they have to choose between parenthood and a career. The former always precedes as it
              becomes the purpose for the latter’s existence. Having a child surely gifts an eternal
              bliss, shuns selfishness, and above all, it brings happiness to life. You should
              realize that having one does not always require sacrificing the other. However, it’s
              highly essential to understand that the clock keeps ticking. There could be many
              reasons for men and women to postpone having a child. For men, a couple of main
              reasons could be anxieties while settling down to start a family and the battle
              between carrying out responsibilities against their advancing age, despite their
              family’s requests, societal threats, and sighs over their decision to plan for
              children. Whereas, for women, the number one reason is having financial freedom. They
              delay childbirth due to not having enough money, and they want to earn a higher salary
              first, be a self-supportive mom, and sometimes establish their dream career before
              having a baby.

                rate doesn’t drop abruptly as a woman’s, this doesn’t mean that every man remains
                capable of having a child throughout his lifetime. The quality of sperm becomes
                poor, and the number of sperms produced, the sperm’s ability to swim (motility), and
                the sperm’s shape (morphology) are all known to change with increasing age. All
                these factors drop significantly during their 40s compared to men in their 30s. Aged
                fathers are closely linked with adverse effects on their children as they are prone
                to damaged sperm DNAs that may lead to risks of unsuccessful pregnancies because of
                fertilization with an unhealthy sperm. This also means a high prevalence of genetic
                defects and disorders such as autism.

                A woman’s peak reproductive years remain between her late teens and late 20s. During
                the 30s, the fertility potential starts to decline. It becomes more drastic by the
                age of 30, and by 45, getting pregnant is difficult for women. Women who conceive
                after their early 30s have a high risk of various medical complications. Late
                pregnancy also affects the fetus’s health in many ways, and as a woman ages, the
                risk of having a baby with missing, ruptured, or extra chromosomes increases
                significantly. Miscarriages and stillbirths are noticed in women who are above 35.
                Multiple pregnancies that lead to various developmental issues for the fetus and
                maternal complications are more common in older women than younger women, as the
                ovaries tend to release more than one egg during a menstrual cycle.
