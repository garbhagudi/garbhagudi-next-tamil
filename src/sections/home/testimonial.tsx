      'I cannot express how much thankful I am to the entire team of GarbhaGudi hospital. We got positive results in the first visit itself. Front desk staff nurses and doctors all are very cooperative. I request to visit this branch once if you are struggling with infertility issues. And one of the best things is the front desk team will follow up with you give reminders for all visits and scans.. overall 10/10 !!!',

      'Thanks to GarbhaGudi for their constant support for the past 6-7 months. The moment we reached the place to get treated, we felt positive vibes. The staff were welcoming with their warm wishes and smile, nurses explained each and every detail post every consultation. I used to receive calls before every appointment which was very much helpful in remembering the visits. I would strongly recommend GarbhaGudi Electronic City for experiencing fertility treatment in a very positive and convincing way. Continue this great job.',

      'I am very happy to visit GarbhaGudi. I would say that they do miracles here. After trying for more than a year and tired of visiting doctors and clinics, I got to know about this place. The doctors and staff are really good, they understand the mental trauma of a couple and they give real mental support to go through all of these. I got my positive pregnancy with their treatment. They have transparency of what treatment they are giving and why. I am forever grateful to GarbhaGudi and the staff. I would suggest all the couples who are trying to conceive must visit here once. Thank you GarbhaGudi for giving me the gift of life.',

      "Extremely happy today. My wife is 90 days pregnant. The timely follow-ups with the treatment made by the doctor and her team is highly appreciated, without which the end result might not have been possible. Also, the hospital won't levy unnecessary treatment costs or treatments. Every procedure had its own cause and a good outcome. I strongly recommend this GarbhaGudi Marathahalli branch for those who are dealing with infertility issues.",
