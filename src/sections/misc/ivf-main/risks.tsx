          Potential Risks of IVF
        </h2>
        <div className='font-content'>
          In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a sophisticated set of treatments intended to improve
          fertility, avoid genetic issues, and aid in child conception. IVF success rates are
          influenced by a number of variables, including age and the underlying reason of
          infertility. IVF can also be costly, intrusive, and time-consuming. While IVF can be a
          successful treatment for infertility, it is not without risks. Here are some potential
          risks associated with IVF:

          <ul className='list-outside list-disc space-y-3'>
            <li>
              <strong>Multiple Pregnancies:</strong> One of the risks of IVF is the possibility of
              multiple pregnancies, which can occur if more than one embryo is transferred to the
              uterus. Multiple pregnancies carry a higher risk of premature birth, low birth weight,
              and other complications.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS): </strong> OHSS is a condition that
              can occur when the ovaries become swollen and painful due to the medications used to
              stimulate egg production during IVF. In severe cases, OHSS can cause shortness of
              breath, abdominal pain, and other serious symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ectopic Pregnancy:</strong> An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs
              outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. It is a rare but serious
              complication that can occur after IVF. Ectopic pregnancies cannot continue to term and
              require medical intervention.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Psychological stress:</strong> The process of trying to get pregnant through
              IVF can be emotionally and financially draining, and it can cause a great deal of
              stress for both partners. The disappointment of unsuccessful IVF cycles can be
              especially difficult to cope with.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Birth Defects:</strong> Some studies have suggested that children conceived
              through IVF may be more likely to have certain birth defects, such as heart
              abnormalities or chromosomal abnormalities. However, the overall risk of birth defects
              in children conceived through IVF is low, and many studies have not found a higher
              risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Side effects of medication:</strong> The medications used to stimulate egg
              production during IVF can cause side effects such as hot flashes, mood changes, and
              breast tenderness. These side effects are usually temporary and go away after the
              medication is stopped.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pain and discomfort:</strong> The injections and other procedures involved in
              IVF can cause some discomfort and pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk of infection:</strong> There is a small risk of infection during the IVF
              process, particularly if the egg retrieval procedure is performed under general
              anesthesia.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cost:</strong> IVF can be an expensive treatment, and it may not be covered by
              insurance. The cost can be a financial burden for many people.
            </li>
          </ul>

            It is important to carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits of IVF with a
            fertility specialist before deciding whether or not to pursue IVF in Bangalore. It is
            also important to have a strong support system in place to help cope with the emotional
            and financial demands of the process.
