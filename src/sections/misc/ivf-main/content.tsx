                  IVF or In Vitro Fertilization is one of the more widely known types of Assisted
                  Reproductive Techniques (ART). It involves retrieving eggs from the woman's
                  ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory dish. The resulting
                  embryos are then transferred back into the woman's uterus in the hope of achieving
                  a successful pregnancy. GarbhaGudi IVF center offers state-of-the-art facilities
                  and a team of experienced doctors and embryologists who work together to provide
                  personalized care and support to couples undergoing IVF in Bangalore. With the

                  <strong>Initial consultation:</strong> The first step in the IVF process is
                  usually a consultation with a fertility specialist. During this appointment, the
                  specialist will discuss the person's medical history, perform a physical
                  examination, and order any necessary tests to determine the cause of infertility.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ovarian stimulation:</strong> The next step is to stimulate the production
                  of multiple eggs. This is typically done using injectable medications, such as
                  gonadotropins or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. The goal is to produce
                  several mature eggs that can be retrieved and fertilized during the IVF process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Egg retrieval:</strong> Once the eggs are mature, they are retrieved using
                  a procedure called transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval. This procedure
                  is performed under conscious sedation or general anesthesia and involves inserting
                  a needle through the vagina and into the ovaries to remove the eggs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fertilization:</strong> The retrieved eggs are mixed with sperm in a
                  laboratory setting to allow fertilization to occur. If the fertilized eggs are
                  deemed to be healthy and viable, they are allowed to grow for a few more days in
                  the laboratory.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Embryo transfer:</strong> If the fertilized eggs have developed into
                  embryos, one or more of them may be transferred to the uterus. The embryo transfer
                  procedure is usually performed a few days after the egg retrieval procedure and
                  involves inserting a thin tube through the cervix and into the uterus. The embryos
                  are then gently placed into the uterus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pregnancy test:</strong> A pregnancy test is usually performed about two
                  weeks after the embryo transfer procedure to determine whether or not the IVF
                  cycle was successful. If the test is positive, the person is considered pregnant.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <div className='mt-8 font-content'>
              One full IVF cycle takes about three weeks but sometimes the procedure is split into
              parts, to manage certain challenges in the couples. This may delay the process. IVF
              can be done using the woman’s eggs and the male partner’s sperm or it may involve
              sperm, eggs or embryos from anonymous donors.

              It is important to note that not all IVF cycles result in pregnancy, and it may be
              necessary to try multiple cycles before achieving a successful pregnancy. The success
              rate of IVF depends on a variety of factors, including the person's age, the cause of
              infertility, and the quality of the eggs and sperm.
