              When is IVF Recommended?
            </h2>
            <div className='mt-4 font-content text-lg'>
              Some common reasons for recommending IVF include:
              <ul className='mt-4 space-y-3 text-base'>
                <li>
                  <strong>Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes:</strong> If the fallopian tubes are
                  blocked or damaged, the egg may not be able to travel from the ovaries to the
                  uterus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Male fertility problems:</strong> If the male partner has a low sperm
                  count or poor sperm quality, IVF may be recommended.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Unexplained infertility:</strong> If the cause of infertility is unknown,
                  IVF may be recommended.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ovulation disorders:</strong> If a woman is not ovulating regularly or at
                  all, IVF may be recommended.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Endometriosis:</strong> This is a condition in which the tissue that lines
                  the uterus grows outside of the uterus, which can cause fertility problems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Advanced maternal age:</strong> As a woman gets older, her fertility
                  decreases, and IVF may be recommended for women over the age of 35 who are trying
                  to get pregnant.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div className='mt-4 text-base'>
                It is important to note that IVF is a complex and expensive procedure, and it is not
                always successful. It is important to discuss all of the potential risks and
                benefits with a fertility specialist before deciding whether or not to pursue IVF.
