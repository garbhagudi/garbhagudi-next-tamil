            Potential Risks of IUI
          </h2>
          <div className='font-content'>
            IUI is generally considered a safe and low-invasive procedure with minimal risks.
            However, there are some risk factors associated with the procedure:

              <li>
                <strong>Multiple Pregnancies:</strong> IUI increases the chance of having twins or
                triplets, which can be associated with risks such as preterm labor, low birth
                weight, and complications during delivery.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS): </strong> This is a rare but
                serious condition that can occur when ovaries become swollen and painful after
                ovulation induction medication.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ectopic Pregnancy:</strong> Ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg
                implants outside the uterus, and it is a serious condition that can be
                life-threatening.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Infection:</strong> There is a small risk of infection associated with the
                procedure, although this can usually be prevented by proper cleaning of the cervix
                before the procedure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Allergic reactions to medications:</strong> Some women may experience an
                allergic reaction to the medications used during the procedure.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div className='mt-4 font-content'>
              It's important to note that these risks are rare and can be minimized by working with
              an experienced fertility specialist. It's always best to discuss the potential risks
              and benefits of the procedure with your doctor before deciding to undergo IUI.
