        Infertility is defined as the inability to establish a pregnancy after trying to conceive
        for one year. Impotence or erectile dysfunction is the inability of a man to achieve or

        recurrent ejaculation with minimal stimulation. However, men experiencing fertility problems
        may be potent, and men with erectile dysfunction may still be fertile.
