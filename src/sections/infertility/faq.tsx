    Question: 'Does age impact fertility?',
    Answer:
      'Yes, age can significantly impact fertility. Fertility tends to decline as a person gets older, particularly for women. Women are born with a finite number of eggs, and their quality and quantity decrease over time. This can lead to difficulties in conceiving and a higher risk of miscarriages and birth defects as age increases. Men also experience a gradual decline in fertility with age, with potential impacts on sperm quality and reproductive function.',

    Question: 'How long does it take to get pregnant after fertility treatment?',
    Answer:
      "The time it takes to get pregnant after fertility treatment can vary widely depending on the specific treatment, individual factors, and the success of the treatment. Some couples may achieve pregnancy in the first treatment cycle, while others may require multiple cycles. For example, in IVF, it typically takes a few weeks for the entire treatment cycle, from ovarian stimulation to embryo transfer. After the embryo transfer, it can take around 10-14 days to determine if the treatment was successful through a pregnancy test. However, it's important to note that not all fertility treatments result in pregnancy, and some individuals or couples may require more time or adjustments to their treatment plan.",
