          <p className=''>
            Infertility can be a complex issue, influenced by various factors that affect both men
            and women. Some common causes of infertility include hormonal imbalances, ovulation
            disorders, uterine or fallopian tube abnormalities, sperm abnormalities, and age-related
            factors.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-4'>
            Lifestyle factors, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and stress,
            can also play a role in infertility. Additionally, medical conditions like
            endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and certain genetic conditions can
            contribute to fertility challenges.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-4'>
            At our infertility treatment center, we conduct thorough evaluations to identify the
            specific causes affecting fertility for each individual or couple. Our experienced team
            of specialists devises personalized treatment plans to address these underlying factors
